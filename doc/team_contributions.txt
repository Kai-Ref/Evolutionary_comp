Contributions:

Kai:
- Worked on Task 1, 2 and 3: 
    - Task 1: Fine tuned specific functionality and parts of the Indivdual class.
    - Task 2:
        - Implemented exchange and 2-opt mutation operations.
        - Developed vectorized fitness evaluation for all three operations.
        - Optimized the local search algorithm by considering solely the indices and switching to vectorized calculations.
        - Ran all experiments and analyzed results.
    - Task 3: Fine tuned specific functionality and parts of the Indivdual class.

Marcel:
- Set up and implemented plan/organization of the code layout, including modularity, inheritance, etc.
- Worked on Task 1, 2 and 3: 
    - Task 1: Implemented the layout for the TSP class and its modularity.
    - Task 2:
        - Implemented jump mutation operation.
        - Implemented the LocalSearch class and its functionality. 
    - Task 3: Implemented the Individual and Population classes.

Sharada:
- Worked on Task 5 and 6 (Selection + Evolutionary Algorithm):
    - Task 5:
        - Implemented parent selection operators (Tournament and Fitness-Proportional).
    - Task 6:
        - Implemented the EvolutionaryAlgorithm class and Variant A.
        - Integrated Order Crossover (OX) and Exchange (swap) mutation operators.
        - Added seeding for reproducibility and logging of per-generation results.
        - Developed benchmarking and validation scripts (quick_validate.py, benchmark_stub.py).
        - Performed validation runs on TSPlib instance eil51 and generated results for handover.

Gabriel:
- Worked on Task 5
    - Task 5:
        - Implemented selection operators: (Elitism, FitnessBased and Tournament) in main branch.
