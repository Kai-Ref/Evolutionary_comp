        - Implemented exchange and 2-opt mutation operations.
        - Developed vectorized fitness evaluation for all three operations.
        - Optimized the local search algorithm by considering solely the indices and switching to vectorized calculations.
        - Ran all experiments and analyzed results.
    - Task 3: Fine tuned specific functionality and parts of the Indivdual class.
