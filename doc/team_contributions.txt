Contributions:

Kai:
- Worked on Task 1, 2 and 3: 
    - Task 1: Fine tuned specific functionality and parts of the Indivdual class.
    - Task 2:
        - Implemented exchange and 2-opt mutation operations.
        - Developed vectorized fitness evaluation for all three operations.
        - Optimized the local search algorithm by considering solely the indices and switching to vectorized calculations.
        - Ran all experiments and analyzed results.
    - Task 3: Fine tuned specific functionality and parts of the Indivdual class.

Marcel:
- Set up and implemented plan/organization of the code layout, including modularity, inheritance, etc.
- Worked on Task 1, 2 and 3: 
    - Task 1: Implemented the layout for the TSP class and its modularity.
    - Task 2:
        - Implemented jump mutation operation.
        - Implemented the LocalSearch class and its functionality. 
    - Task 3: Implemented the Individual and Population classes.

Dylan:
- Helped Marcel plan the organization of the program
- Worked on Task 4, 6:
    -Task 4:
        -Implemented all Crossover Operations (Order, PMX, Cycles, EdgeRecombination)
    -Task 6:
        - Designed the second evolutionary algorithm (type B: crossover-only)

Gabriel
- Worked on Task 5:
    - Implemented all Selection Operations (Fitness, Tournament, Elitism)

Raiyan
- Worked on Task 6:
    - Implemented the EvolutionaryAlgorithm class
    - Designed the first evolutionary algorithm (type A: crossover+mutation)

Bangamuarachchi
- Worked on Task 6:
    - Designed the third evolutionary algorithm (type C: mutation only)
