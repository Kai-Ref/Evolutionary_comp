# Evolutionary Computation - Assignment 1: TSP

## Usage
### Setup
 1. Ensure that Python 3.10 or later is installed.
 2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to gather and install required libraries.

### Local Search
In order to run the local search algorithm simply run: `python main.py -f [dataset] -m [algorithm to use]`. Additional options are also available see `python main.py -h`. An example of automated running can be found in `script.sh`.
### Evolutionary Algorithm
In order to run the evolutionary algorithm simply run `python evolution.py`.
